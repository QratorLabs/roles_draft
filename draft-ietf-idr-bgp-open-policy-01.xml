   <abstract>
     <t>
       Route Leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes which violate
       assumptions of BGP topology relationships; e.g. passing a route
       learned from one peer to another peer or to a transit provider,
       passing a route learned from one transit provider to another
       transit provider or to a peer.  Today, approaches to leak
       prevention rely on marking routes according to operator
       configuration options without any check that the configuration
       corresponds to that of the BGP neighbor, or enforcement that the
       two BGP speakers agree on the relationship.  This document
       enhances BGP Open to establish agreement of the (peer, customer,
       provider, internal) relationship of two neighboring BGP speakers
       to enforce appropriate configuration on both sides. Propagated
       routes are then marked with an iOTC attribute according to agreed
       relationship allowing prevention of route leaks.
     </t>

   <note title="Requirements Language">
     <t>
       The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

     <section title="Peering Relationships" anchor="peering">
       <t>
	 Despite uses of words such as "Customer," "Peer." etc. the
	 intent is not business relationships, who pays whom, etc.
	 These are common terms to represent restrictions on BGP
	 propagation, some times known as Gao/Rexford.  E.g. if A is a
	 "peer" of B and C, A does not propagate B's prefixes to C.  If
	 D is a "customer" of E and F, D does not propagate prefixes
	 learned from E to F.
       </t>
       <t>
	 As the whole point of route leak detection and prevention is to
	 prevent vioation of these relationships, they are inescapable.
       </t>
     </section>

   </section>
   
   <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
    <t>
       This document specifies a new BGP Capability Code, <xref
       target="RFC5492"></xref> Sec 4, which two BGP speakers MAY use to
       ensure that they MUST agree on their relationship; i.e. customer
       and provider or peers.  Either or both may optionally be
       configured to require that this option be exchanged for the BGP
       Open to succeed. </t>
     <t>
       Also this document specifies a way to mark routes according to
       BGP Roles established in OPEN and a way to create double-boundary
       filters for prevention of route leaks via new BGP Path Attribute.
     </t>
     <t>
       For the purpose of this document, BGP route leaks are when a BGP
       route was learned from transit provider or peer and is announced
       to another provider or peer.  See <xref
       target="I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition"/>.  These
       are usually the result of misconfigured or absent BGP route
       filtering or lack of coordination between two BGP speakers.
     </t>

     <t>
       <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-route-leak-detection-mitigation"/>
       The mechanism proposed in that draft provides the
       opportunity to detect route leaks made by third parties but
       provides no support to strongly prevent route leak creation.
     </t>

     <t>
       Also, route tagging which relies on operator maintained policy
       configuration is too easily and too often misconfigured.
     </t>

   </section>

   <section anchor="defs" title="Role Definitions">
     <t>As many of these terms are used differently in various contexts,
       it is worth being explicit.  <list style="hanging">
       <t hangText="A Provider:"> sends their own routes and (possibly) a
         subset of routes learned from their other customers, peers, and
	 transit providers to their customer.</t>
       <t hangText="A Customer:"> accepts 'transit routes' from its
         provider(s) and announces their own routes and the routes they
         have learned from the transitive closure of their customers (AKA
         their 'customer cone') to their provider(s).</t>
       <t hangText="A Peer:"> announces their routes and the routes from
         their customer cone to other Peers.</t>
       <t hangText="An Internal:"> announces all routes, accepts all routes.</t>
       </list></t>
       <t>Of course, any BGP speaker may apply policy to reduce what is
         announced, and a recipient may apply policy to reduce the set
	 of routes they accept.</t>
     </section>
       
   <section anchor="bgp_role" title="BGP Role">
     <t>
       BGP Role is new configuration option that SHOULD be configured at each BGP session.
       It reflects the real-world agreement between two BGP speakers about their peering relationship.
     </t>

     <t>Allowed Role values are: <list style="symbols">
         <t>Provider - sender is a transit provider to neighbor;</t>
         <t>Customer - sender is customer of neighbor;</t>
         <t>Peer     - sender and neighbor are peers;</t>
         <t>
           Internal - sender and neighbor is part of same organization.
           This includes but is not limited to situation when sender and neighbor are in same AS.
         </t>
       </list> </t>
     <t>Since BGP Role reflects the relationship between two BGP
     speakers, it could also be used for more than route leak
     mitigation.</t>

     </section>

   <section anchor="correctness" title="Role correctness">
     <t><xref target="bgp_role"/> described how BGP Role is a reflection
     of the relationship between two BGP speakers. But the mere presence
     of BGP Role doesn't automatically guarantee role agreement between
     two BGP peers.</t>

     <t>To enforce correctness, the BGP Role check is used with a set
     of constrains on how speakers' BGP Roles MUST corresponded.  Of
     course, each speaker MUST announce and accept the BGP Role
      capability in the BGP OPEN message exchange.</t>

     <t>
       If a speaker receives a BGP Role capability, it MUST check
       value of the received capability with its own BGP Role (if it is set).
       The allowed pairings are (first a sender's Role, second the receiver's
       Role):
     </t>
     <texttable anchor="allowed" title="Allowed Role Capabilities" suppress-title="false">
     <ttcol align="left"> Sender Role </ttcol>
     <ttcol align="left"> Receiver Role </ttcol>
     <c> Peer     </c> <c> Peer     </c>
     <c> Provider </c> <c> Customer </c>
     <c> Customer </c> <c> Provider </c>
     <c> Internal </c> <c> Internal </c>
     </texttable>
     <t> In all other cases speaker MUST send a Role Mismatch
     Notification (code 2, sub-code &lt;TBD2&gt;). </t>

     <section title="Strict mode" anchor="strict">
     <t>A new BGP configuration option "strict mode" is defined with
     values of true or false. If set to true, then the speaker MUST
     refuse to establish a BGP session with peers which do not announce
     the BGP Role capability in their OPEN message. If a speaker rejects
     a connection, it MUST send a Connection Rejected Notification <xref
     target="RFC4486"/> (Notification with error code 6, subcode 5).  By
     default strict mode SHOULD be set to false for backward
     compatibility with BGP speakers, that do not yet support this
     mechanism.</t>
    </section>
   </section>

   <section anchor="prevention_attribute" title="BGP Internal Only To Customer attribute">
     <t>
       The Internal Only To Customer (iOTC) attribute is a new optional,
       non-transitive BGP Path attribute with the Type Code
       &lt;TBD3&gt;.  This attribute has zero length as it is used only as
       a flag.
     </t>
     
     <t> There are three rules of iOTC attribute usage:
         <list style="numbers">
           <t>
             The iOTC attribute MUST be added to all incoming routes if
             the receiver's Role is Customer or Peer;
           </t>
           <t>
             Routes with the iOTC attribute set MUST NOT be announced by
             a sender whose Role is Customer or Peer;
           </t>
           <t>
             A sender MUST NOT include this attribute in UPDATE messages
             if its Role is Customer, Provider or Peer. If it is contained in an UPDATE message
             and receiver's Role is Customer, Provider, Peer or unspecified,
             then this attribute MUST be removed.
           </t>
         </list>
         These three rules provide mechanism that strongly prevents route
         leak creation by an AS.
       </t>
   </section>

   <section anchor="attrs" title="Attribute or Community">

     <t>Having the relationship hard set by agreement between the two
     peers in BGP OPEN is critical; the routers enforce the relationship
     irrespective of operator configuration errors.</t>

     <t>Similarly, it is critical that the application of that
     relationship on prefix propagation using iOTC is enforced by the
     router(s), and minimally exposed to user misconfiguration.  There
     is a question whether the iOTC marking should be an attribute or a
     well-known community.</t>

     <t>There is a long and sordid history of mis-configurations
     inserting incorrect communities, deleting communities, ignoring
     well-known community markings etc.  In this mechanism's case, an
     operator could, for example, accidentally strip the well-known
     community on receipt.</t>

     <t>As opposed to communities, BGP attributes may not be generally
     modified or filtered by the operator.  The router(s) enforce them.
     This is the desired property for the iOTC marking.  Hence, this
     document specifies iOTC as an attribute.</t>

   </section>

   <section anchor="security" title="Compatibility with BGPsec">
     <t>
       As the iOTC field is non-transitive, it is not seen by or
       signed by BGPsec <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol"></xref>.
     </t>
   </section>
   

   <section anchor="considerations" title="Additional Considerations">
     <t>As the BGP Role reflects the relationship between neighbors, it
     can also have other uses.  As an example, BGP Role might affect
     route priority, or be used to distinguish borders of a network if a
     network consists of multiple AS.</t>
     <t>Though such uses may be worthwhile, they are not the goal of
      this document.  Note that such uses would require local policy
      control. </t>
     <t>
       As BGP role configuration results in automatic creation of inbound/outbound
       filters, existence of roles should be treated as existence of Import and Export policy.
       <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-bgp-reject"></xref>
     </t>
     <t>
       This document doesn't provide any security measures to check
       correctness of iOTC usage if role isn't configured.
