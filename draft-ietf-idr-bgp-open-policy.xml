    <abstract>
      <t>
        Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes that violate assumptions of BGP topology relationships, e.g., announcing a route learned from one transit provider to another transit provider or a lateral (i.e., non-transit) peer or announcing a route learned from one lateral peer to another lateral peer or a transit provider.
        These are usually the result of misconfigured or absent BGP route filtering or lack of coordination between autonomous systems (ASes).
        Existing approaches to leak prevention rely on marking routes by operator configuration, with no check that the configuration corresponds to that of the eBGP neighbor, or enforcement that the two eBGP speakers agree on the relationship.
        This document enhances the BGP OPEN message to establish an agreement of the relationship on each eBGP session between autonomous systems in order to enforce appropriate configuration on both sides.
        Propagated routes are then marked according to the agreed relationship, allowing both prevention and detection of route leaks.

      <t>
        Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes that violate assumptions of BGP topology relationships, e.g., announcing a route learned from one transit provider to another transit provider or a lateral (i.e., non-transit) peer or announcing a route learned from one lateral peer to another lateral peer or a transit provider <xref target="RFC7908"/>.
        These are usually the result of misconfigured or absent BGP route filtering or lack of coordination between autonomous systems (ASes).
      </t>
      <t>
        Existing approaches to leak prevention rely on marking routes by operator configuration, with no check that the configuration corresponds to that of the eBGP neighbor, or enforcement that the two eBGP speakers agree on the relationship.
        This document enhances the BGP OPEN message to establish an agreement of the relationship on each eBGP session between autonomous systems in order to enforce appropriate configuration on both sides.
        Propagated routes are then marked according to the agreed relationship, allowing both prevention and detection of route leaks.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document provides configuration automation using BGP Roles, which are negotiated using a BGP Role Capability in the OPEN message <xref target="RFC5492"/>.
        An eBGP speaker may require the use of this capability and confirmation of BGP Role with a neighbor for the BGP OPEN to succeed.
      </t>

      <t>
        An optional, transitive BGP Path Attribute, called Only to Customer (OTC), is specified in <xref target="prevention_attribute"/>.
        It prevents ASes from creating leaks and detects leaks created by the ASes in the middle of an AS path.
        The main focus/applicability is the Internet (IPv4 and IPv6 unicast route advertisements).
      </t>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>
        In the rest of this document, the term "Peer" is used to refer to a "lateral (i.e., non-transit) peer" for simplicity.
        Also, the terms Provider and Customer are used to refer to a transit provider and a transit customer, respectively. Further, the terms RS and RS-Client are used to refer to a Route Server and its client, respectively.
      </t>
      <t>
        The terms "local AS" and "remote AS" are used to refer to the two ends of an eBGP session.
        The "local AS" is the AS where the protocol action being described is to be performed, and "remote AS" is the AS at the other end of the eBGP session in consideration.
      </t>

      <t>
        The use of the term "route is ineligible" in this document has the same meaning as in <xref target="RFC4271"/>, i.e., "route is ineligible to be installed in Loc-RIB and will be excluded from the next phase of route selection."
      </t>
</section>

     </section>

    <section anchor="defs" title="Peering Relationships">
      <t>
        The terms defined and used in this document (see below) do not necessarily represent business relationships based on payment agreements.
        These terms are used to represent restrictions on BGP route propagation, sometimes known as the Gao-Rexford model <xref target="Gao"/>.
        The following is a list of BGP Roles for eBGP peering and the corresponding rules for route propagation:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Provider:">
            MAY propagate any available route to a Customer.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Customer:">
            MAY propagate any route learned from a Customer, or locally originated, to a Provider.
            All other routes MUST NOT be propagated.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Route Server (RS):">
            MAY propagate any available route to a Route Server Client (RS-Client).
          </t>
          <t hangText="RS-Client:">
            MAY propagate any route learned from a Customer, or locally originated, to an RS.
            All other routes MUST NOT be propagated.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Peer:">
            MAY propagate any route learned from a Customer, or locally originated, to a Peer.
            All other routes MUST NOT be propagated.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        A BGP speaker may apply policy to reduce what is announced, and a recipient may apply policy to reduce the set of routes they accept.
        Violation of the above rules may result in route leaks.
        Automatic enforcement of these rules should significantly reduce route leaks that may otherwise occur due to manual configuration mistakes.
      </t>
      <t>
        As specified in <xref target="prevention_attribute"/>, the Only to Customer (OTC) Attribute is used to identify all the routes in the AS that have been received from a Peer, Provider, or RS.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="bgp_role" title="BGP Role">
      <t>
        The BGP Role characterizes the relationship between the eBGP speakers forming a session.
        One of the Roles described below SHOULD be configured at the local AS for each eBGP session at interdomain routing level (see definitions in <xref target="terminology"/>) based on the local AS's knowledge of its Role.
        The only exception is when the eBGP connection is 'complex' (see <xref target="considerations"/>).
        BGP Roles are mutually confirmed using the BGP Role Capability (described in <xref target="capability"/>) on each eBGP session.
      </t>
      <t>
        Allowed Roles for eBGP sessions are:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Provider - the local AS is a transit Provider of the remote AS;</t>
          <t>Customer - the local AS is a transit Customer of the remote AS;</t>
          <t>RS - the local AS is a Route Server (usually at an Internet exchange point) and the remote AS is its RS-Client;</t>
          <t>RS-Client - the local AS is a client of an RS and the RS is the remote AS;</t>
          <t>Peer - the local and remote ASes are Peers (i.e., have a lateral peering relationship).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <section anchor="capability" title="BGP Role Capability">
        <t>
          The BGP Role Capability is defined as follows:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Code - 9</t>
            <t>Length - 1 (octet)</t>
            <t>Value - integer corresponding to speaker's BGP Role (see <xref target="values"/>).</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <texttable anchor="values" title="Predefined BGP Role Values" suppress-title="false">
          <ttcol align="center">Value</ttcol>
          <ttcol align="left">Role name (for the local AS)</ttcol>
          <c>0</c>
          <c>Provider</c>
          <c>1</c>
          <c>RS</c>

          <c>Unassigned</c>
        </texttable>
        <t>
          If BGP Role is locally configured, the eBGP speaker MUST advertise BGP Role Capability in the BGP OPEN message.
          An eBGP speaker MUST NOT advertise multiple versions of the BGP Role Capability.
        </t>

      </section>
      <section anchor="correctness" title="Role Correctness">
        <t>
          <xref target="capability"/> described how BGP Role encodes the relationship on each eBGP session between autonomous systems (ASes).
        </t>

        <t>
          The mere receipt of BGP Role Capability does not automatically guarantee the Role agreement between two eBGP neighbors.
          If the BGP Role Capability is advertised, and one is also received from the peer, the roles MUST correspond to the relationships in Table 2.
          If the roles do not correspond, the BGP speaker MUST reject the connection using the Role Mismatch Notification (code 2, subcode 8).
        </t>
        <texttable anchor="allowed" title="Allowed Pairs of Role Capabilities" suppress-title="false">
          <ttcol align="left">Local AS Role</ttcol>

          <c>Peer</c>
        </texttable>
        <t>
          For backward compatibility, if the BGP Role Capability is sent but one is not received, the BGP Speaker SHOULD ignore the absence of the BGP Role Capability and proceed with session establishment.
          The locally configured BGP Role is used for the procedures described in <xref target="prevention_attribute"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          An operator may choose to apply a "strict mode" in which the receipt of a BGP Role Capability from the remote AS is required.
          When operating in the "strict mode", if the BGP Role Capability is sent, but one is not received, then the connection is rejected using the Role Mismatch Notification (code 2, subcode 8).
        </t>
        <t>
          If an eBGP speaker receives multiple but identical BGP Role Capabilities with the same value in each, then the speaker must consider it to be a single BGP Role Capability and proceed <xref target="RFC5492"/>.
          If multiple BGP Role Capabilities are received and not all of them have the same value, then the BGP speaker MUST reject the connection using the Role Mismatch Notification (code 2, subcode 8).
        </t>
        <t>
          The BGP Role value for the local AS is used in the route leak prevention and detection procedures described in <xref target="prevention_attribute"/>.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="prevention_attribute" title="BGP Only to Customer (OTC) Attribute">
      <t>
        The Only to Customer (OTC) Attribute is an optional transitive path attribute with Attribute Type Code 35 and a length of 4 octets.
        The purpose of this attribute is to guarantee that once a route is sent to a Customer, Peer, or RS-Client, it will subsequently go only to Customers.
        The attribute value is an AS number determined by the policy described below.
      </t>
      <t>
        The following ingress policy applies to the processing of the OTC Attribute:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            If a route with the OTC Attribute is received from a Customer or RS-Client, then it is a route leak and MUST be considered ineligible (see <xref target="terminology"/>).
          </t>
          <t>
            If a route with the OTC Attribute is received from a Peer and at least one of the OTC Attributes has a value that is not equal to the remote (i.e., Peer's) AS number, then it is a route leak and MUST be considered ineligible.
          </t>
          <t>
            If a route is received from a Provider, Peer, or RS, and the OTC Attribute is not present, then it MUST be added with a value equal to the AS number of the remote AS.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        The following egress policy applies to the processing of  the OTC Attribute:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            If a route is to be advertised to a Customer, Peer, or RS-Client (when the sender is an RS), and the OTC Attribute is not present, then an OTC Attribute MUST be added with a value equal to the AS number of the local AS.
          </t>
          <t>
            If a route already contains the OTC Attribute, it MUST NOT be propagated to Providers, Peers, or RS(s).
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        The described policies provide both leak prevention for the local AS and leak detection and mitigation multiple hops away.
        In the case of prevention at the local AS, the presence of an OTC Attribute indicates to the egress router that the route was learned from a Peer, Provider, or RS, and it can be advertised only to the customers.
        The same OTC Attribute which is set locally also provides a way to detect route leaks by an AS multiple hops away if a route is received from a Customer, Peer, or RS-Client.
      </t>

      <t>
        The OTC Attribute may be set by the egress policy of the remote AS or by the ingress policy of the local AS.
        In both scenarios, the OTC value will be the same.
        This makes the scheme more robust and benefits early adopters.
      </t>

      <t>
        If an eBGP speaker receives an UPDATE with an OTC Attribute with a length different from 4 octets, then the UPDATE SHALL be considered malformed.
        If malformed, the UPDATE message SHALL be handled using the approach of "treat-as-withdraw" <xref target="RFC7606"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        The procedures specified in this document are NOT RECOMMENDED to be used between autonomous systems in an AS Confederation <xref target="RFC5065"/>.
        If an OTC Attribute is added on egress from the AS Confederation, its value MUST equal the AS Confederation Identifier.
        Also, on egress from the AS Confederation, an UPDATE MUST NOT contain an OTC Attribute with a value corresponding to any Member-AS Number other than the AS Confederation Identifier.
      </t>

      <t>
        Once the OTC Attribute has been set, it MUST be preserved unchanged (this also applies to an AS Confederation).
      </t>

      <t>
        Correct implementation of the procedures specified in this document is not expected to result in the presence of multiple OTC Attributes in an UPDATE.
        However, if an eBGP speaker receives multiple OTC Attributes with a route, then the only difference in the processing is in Step 2 of the ingress policy.
      </t>

      <t>
        The described ingress and egress policies are applicable only for unicast IPv4 and IPv6 address families and MUST NOT be applied to other address families by default.
        The operator MUST NOT have the ability to modify the policies defined in this section.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="considerations" title="Additional Considerations">
      <t>
        There are peering relationships that are 'complex', i.e., both parties intentionally advertise prefixes received from each other to their Peers and/or transit Providers.
        If multiple eBGP sessions can segregate the 'complex' parts of the relationship, then the complex peering roles can be segregated into different normal eBGP sessions, and BGP Roles MUST be used on each of the resulting normal (non-complex) eBGP sessions.
      </t>

      <t>
        No Roles SHOULD be configured on a 'complex' eBGP session (assuming it is not segregated).
        An operator may want to achieve an equivalent outcome by configuring policies on a per-prefix basis to follow the definitions of peering relations as described in <xref target="defs"/>.
        However, in this case, there are no built-in measures to check the correctness of the per-prefix peering configuration.
      </t>

      <t>
        The incorrect setting of BGP Roles and/or OTC Attributes may affect prefix propagation.
        Further, this document does not specify any special handling of incorrect AS numbers in the OTC Attribute.
      </t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">

        IANA has registered a new BGP Capability (<xref target="capability"/>) in the "Capability Codes" registry's "IETF Review" range <xref target="RFC5492"/>.

        IANA has registered a new OPEN Message Error subcode named the "Role Mismatch" (see <xref target="correctness"/>) in the OPEN Message Error subcodes registry.
        IANA has assigned the value 8 [to be removed upon publication: https://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-parameters/bgp-parameters.xhtml#bgp-parameters-6].
        This document is the reference for the new subcode.
      </t>

      <t>
        IANA has also registered a new path attribute named "Only to Customer (OTC)" (see <xref target="prevention_attribute"/>) in the "BGP Path Attributes" registry.
        IANA has assigned code value 35 [To be removed upon publication: http://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-parameters/bgp-parameters.xhtml#bgp-parameters-2].
        This document is the reference for the new attribute.

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        The security considerations of BGP (as specified in <xref target="RFC4271"/> and <xref target="RFC4272"/>) apply.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document proposes a mechanism using BGP Role for the prevention and detection of route leaks that are the result of BGP policy misconfiguration.
        A misconfiguration of the BGP Role may affect prefix propagation.
        For example, if a downstream (i.e., towards a Customer) peering link were misconfigured with a Provider or Peer role, this will limit the number of prefixes that can be advertised in this direction.
        On the other hand, if an upstream provider were misconfigured (by a local AS) with the Customer role, this may result in propagating routes that are received from other Providers or Peers.
        But the BGP Role negotiation and the resulting confirmation of Roles make such misconfigurations unlikely.
      </t>

      <t>
        Setting the strict mode of operation for BGP Role negotiation as the default may result in a situation where the eBGP session will not come up after a software update.
        Implementations with such default behavior are strongly discouraged.
      </t>
      <t>
        Applying the specified procedures using the OTC Attribute (<xref target="prevention_attribute"/>) between internal network structures, for example in an AS Confederation, may lead to incorrect route filtering thus may be applied only on locally originated routes that are not supposed to be advertised beyond network boundaries.
      </t>

      <t>
        Removing the OTC Attribute or changing its value can limit the opportunity of route leak detection.
        Such activity can be done on purpose as part of an on-path attack.
        For example, an AS can remove the OTC Attribute on a received route and then leak the route to its transit provider.
        This kind of threat is not new in BGP and it may affect any Attribute (BGPsec <xref target="RFC8205"/> offers protection only for the AS_PATH Attribute.
      </t>

      <t>
        Adding an OTC Attribute when the route is advertised from Customer to Provider will limit the propagation of the route.
        Such a route may be considered as ineligible by the immediate Provider or its Peers or upper layer Providers.
        This kind of OTC Attribute addition is unlikely to happen on the Provider side because it will limit the traffic volume towards its Customer.
        On the Customer side, adding an OTC Attribute for traffic engineering purposes is also discouraged because it will limit route propagation in an unpredictable way.
