   <abstract>
     <t>
       Route Leaks are propagation of BGP prefixes which violate
       assumptions of BGP topology relationships; e.g. passing a route
       learned from one peer to another peer or to a transit provider,
       passing a route learned from one transit provider to another
       transit provider or to a peer.  Today, approaches to leak
       prevention rely on marking routes according to some configuration
       options without any check of the configuration corresponds to
       that of the BGP neighbor, or enforcement that the two BGP
       speakers agree on the relationship.  This document enhances BGP
       Open to establish agreement of the (peer, customer, provider,
       internal) relationship of two BGP neighboring speakers to enforce
       appropriate configuration on both sides. Propagated routes are
       then marked with a flag according to agreed relationship allowing
       detection and mitigation of route leaks.

   <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
     <t>
       For the purposes of this document BGP route leaks are when a BGP
       route was learned from transit provider or peer and is announced
       to another provider or peer.  See
       <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition"/>.
       These are usually the result of misconfigured or absent BGP route
       filtering or lack of coordination between two BGP speakers.
     </t>

     <t>
       <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-route-leak-detection-mitigation"/>
       describes a method of marking and detecting leaks which relies on
       operator maintained markings.  Unfortunately, in most cases, a
       leaking router will likely also be misconfigured to mark
       incorrectly.  The proposed mechanism provides an opportunity to
       detect route leaks made by third parties but provides no support
       to avoid route leak creation. The leak avoidance still relies on
       communities which are optional and often missed due to mistakes
       or misunderstanding of the BGP configuration process.
     </t>

     <t>
       THIS IS GIBBERISH AND I CAN NOT DECIPHER IT
       Meanwhile it has been suggested to use white list filtering which
       relies on customer cone.  Unfortunately, majority of incidents
       are created by leaking routes from customer cone: lot of medium
       size transit operators use global prefix list for its customer
       cone, without paying attention to the source of the learned
       prefix. So if they learn route from its provider or peer - they
       will announce it in all directions, including other providers or
       peers. This misconfiguration limits affected prefixes and
       possible route leaks to customer cone of such transit operator,
       but such route leaks will obviously bypass customer cone
       filtering on its upstream providers.
     </t>
     <t>
       Also, route tagging which relies on operator maintained policy
       configuration is too easily and too often misconfigured.
     </t>

     <t>This document specifies a new BGP Capability Code,
     <xref target="RFC5492"></xref> Sec 4, which two BGP speakers MAY
     use to ensure that they MUST agree on their relationship;
     i.e. customer and provider or peers.  Either or both may optionally
     be configured to require that this option be exchanged for the BGP
     Open to succeed. </t>

     <t>
       Also this document specifies a way to mark routes according to
       BGP Roles and a way to create double-boundary filters for
       detection and preventing propagation of route leaks via a new BGP
       Path Attribute.
     </t>
   </section>

   <section anchor="bgp_role" title="BGP Role">
     <t>BGP Role is new mandatory configuration option. It reflects the
     real-world agreement between two BGP speakers about their business
     relationship.</t>

     <t>For now, possible Role values are: <list style="symbols">
         <t>Provider - speaker is a transit provider to neighbor;</t>
         <t>Customer - speaker is customer of neighbor;</t>
         <t>Peer     - speaker and neighbor are peers;</t>
         <t>Internal - speaker is part of an internal AS of an
         organization which has multiple ASs, is a confederation, ...</t>
       </list> </t>
     <t>Since BGP Role reflects the relationship between two BGP
     speakers, it can also be used for more than route leak
     mitigation.</t>
   </section>

   <section anchor="capability" title="Role capability">
     <t> The TLV (type, length, value) of the BGP Role capability
     are: <list style="symbols">
     <t> Type   - &lt;TBD1&gt;;</t>

   <section anchor="correctness" title="Role correctness">
     <t><xref target="bgp_role"/> described how BGP Role is a reflection
     of the relationship between two BGP speakers. But the mere presence
     of BGP Role doesn't automatically guarantee role agreement between
     two BGP peers.</t>

     <t>To enforce correctness, use the BGP Role check with a set
     of constrains on how speakers' BGP Roles MUST corresponded.  Of
     course, each speaker MUST announce and accept the BGP Role
     capability in the BGP OPEN message exchange.</t>

     <t> If a speaker receives a BGP Role capability, it SHOULD check
     value of received capability with its own BGP Role. The allowed
     pairings are (first is its own Role, second is received
     Role): <list style="symbols">
     <t> (Peer, Peer);  </t>
     <t> (Provider, Customer); </t>
     <t> (Customer, Provider); </t>
     <t> (Internal, Internal); </t>
     </list> In all other cases speaker MUST send a Role Mismatch
     Notification (code 2, sub-code &lt;TBD2&gt;).</t>

     <section title="Strict mode" anchor="strict">
     <t>A new BGP configuration option "strict mode" is defined with
     values of true or false. If set to true, then the speaker MUST
     refust to establish a BGP session with peers which do not announce
     BGP Role capability in their OPEN message. If a speaker rejects a
     connection, it MUST send a Connection Rejected Notification
     <xref target="RFC4486"/> (Notification with error code 6, subcode
     5).  By default strict mode SHOULD be set to false for backward
     compatibility with BGP speakers, that do not yet support this
     mechanism.</t>
    </section>
   </section>

   <section anchor="attribute" title="BGP Announce Vector Marker attribute">
     <t>
       The Announce Vector Marker (AVM) attribute is a new optional,
       transitive BGP Path attribute with the Type Code
       &lt;TBD3&gt;. This attribute has zero length as it used only as a
       flag.
     </t>
     
     <section anchor="usage" title="Attribute usage">
       <t> There are four rules for usage of AVM attribute:
         <list style="numbers">
           <t>
             The AVM attribute SHOULD be added to all incoming routes if
             receiver's Role is Provider or Peer;
           </t>
           <t>
             Routes with the AVM attribute set MUST NOT be announced if
             the speaker's Role is Provider or Peer;
           </t>
           <t>
             The AVM attribute SHOULD be added to all outgoing routes if
             the speaker has not sent the Role capability in the OPEN
             message and speaker's Role is Customer or Peer;
           </t>
           <t>
             If the receiver's Role is Customer or Peer, all incoming
             routes with the AVM attribute set SHOULD have low Local
             Preference Attribute or MAY be filtered.
           </t>
         </list>
         The first two rules avoid creation of route leak inside an AS.
         The last two rules provide detection of route leaks made by
         some other AS in the AS_Path.
       </t>
       <t>
         The AVM attribute will be added, if at least one of speakers
         correctly set its role. In addition, the AVM attribute will be
         checked if at least one of speakers set its role correctly. In
         other words, this double-checks at borders to prevent route
         leaks.
       </t>
     </section>
   </section>
   

   <section anchor="considerations" title="Additional Considerations">
     <t>As BGP Role reflects the relationship between neighbors, it can
     also have other uses.  As an example, BGP Role might affect route
     priority, or be used to distinguish borders of network if a network
     consists of multiple AS.</t>
     <t>Though such uses may be worthwhile, they are not the goal of
      this document.  Note that such uses would require local policy
      control. </t>

   <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
     <t>This document defines a new Capability Codes option, named "BGP

     <xref target="RFC5492"/>. The length of this capability is 1. </t>

     <t>The BGP Role capability includes a Value field, for which IANA
     is requested to create and maintain a new sub-registry called "BGP
     Role Value". Initial values of this registry are to be populated
     with the Values in <xref target="values"/>. Future assignments are

   </section>

   <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
     <t>
       This document proposes a mechanism for avoiding route leaks, that are
       result of misconfiguration. That includes preventing route leaks creation inside AS (company)
       and route leak detection, if route was leaked by third party.
     </t>
     <t>
       Deliberate sending of a known conflicting BGP Role could be used to sabotage a BGP connection.
       This is easily detectable.
     </t>
     <t>
       However, detection of routes with malformed AVM attribute should
       be considered in future works.
     </t>

     <t> Finally, BGP Role is disclosed only to an immediate BGP speaker, so it
     will not itself reveal any sensitive information to third parties. </t>
